            <p class="fancy-text">The tale begins with Carrik's first 
vision under the aurora-filled skies of Yeth, setting him on a path to 
unite a world. "Iceflyer" introduces readers to the icy planet of Yeth 
and the mysteries that Carrik will unravel in his quest to unite the 
human clans and the enigmatic Yeth'l. This seminal work sets the stage 
for the epic Nightsea series, offering a blend of science fiction and 
fantasy that captures the imagination and inspires wonder.</p>
            <p class="review">"Iceflyer sets a new standard for 
exploratory fiction, blending mythic elements with a raw depiction of 
survival against the cosmos. Carun's prose is both poetic and powerful, 
making every page a compelling journey." — Lisa Thompson, Galaxy Gazette</p>
